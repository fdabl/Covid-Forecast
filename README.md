# Interactive Exploration of COVID-19 Forecasts
This Shiny app uses the model described in van Wees et al. ([2020a](https://research.vumc.nl/en/publications/forecasting-hospitalization-and-icu-rates-of-the-covid-19-outbrea), [2020b](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.16.20102947v1)) to allow users to explore forecasts and interventions of COVID-19
in the Netherlands. Note that this Shiny app uses the reticulate R package to inferface with the [TNO SEIR model](https://github.com/TNO/Covid-SEIR). The relevant Python files are included in this repository.
